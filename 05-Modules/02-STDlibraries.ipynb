    "# CSV in Python – Full Breakdown with Syntax & Meaning\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Importing the CSV Module\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔹 `import csv`**  \n",
    "*What it does:*  \n",
    "Imports Python’s built-in `csv` module, which provides tools to read from and write to CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why it’s needed:*  \n",
    "Without importing `csv`, you can’t use `csv.writer()` or `csv.reader()`—they’re part of this module.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Opening a CSV File for Writing\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔹 `with open('example.csv', mode='w', newline='') as file:`**  \n",
    "**Syntax:**  \n",
    "`open(filename, mode, newline)`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **filename:** Name of the file to open or create (e.g., `'example.csv'`)\n",
    "- **mode:** `'w'` means write mode (creates new or overwrites existing file)\n",
    "- **newline='':** Prevents extra blank lines when writing rows (especially on Windows)\n",
    "\n",
    "*What it does:*  \n",
    "Opens the file named `example.csv` for writing. The `with` statement ensures the file is automatically closed after the block finishes.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why it’s used:*  \n",
    "Using `with open(...)` is safer and cleaner than manually opening and closing files. It handles file closing even if errors occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Creating a CSV Writer Object\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔹 `writer = csv.writer(file)`**  \n",
    "**Syntax:**  \n",
    "`csv.writer(file_object)`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **file_object:** The file you opened using `open()`\n",
    "\n",
    "*What it does:*  \n",
    "Creates a writer object that lets you write rows to the CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why it’s used:*  \n",
    "This object has methods like `writerow()` that make writing structured data easy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Writing Rows to the CSV File\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔹 `writer.writerow(['name', 'age'])`**  \n",
    "**Syntax:**  \n",
    "`writer.writerow(list_of_values)`\n",
    "\n",
    "- **list_of_values:** A list where each item becomes a column in the CSV row\n",
    "\n",
    "*What it does:*  \n",
    "Writes a single row to the CSV file. In this case, it writes the header row with column names: `name` and `age`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why it’s used:*  \n",
    "CSV files are structured like tables. The header row defines what each column represents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔹 `writer.writerow(['Avi', 20])`**  \n",
    "*What it does:*  \n",
    "Writes another row with actual data: the name `'Avi'` and age `20`.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why it’s used:*  \n",
    "This is how you add data to your CSV file—one row at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Opening a CSV File for Reading\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔹 `with open('example.csv', mode='r') as file:`**  \n",
    "**Syntax:**  \n",
    "Same as before, but `mode='r'` means read mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "*What it does:*  \n",
    "Opens the file for reading. Again, the `with` block ensures safe file handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why it’s used:*  \n",
    "You can’t read from a file unless it’s opened in read mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. Creating a CSV Reader Object\n",
    "\n",
    "**🔹 `reader = csv.reader(file)`**  \n",
    "**Syntax:**  \n",
    "`csv.reader(file_object)`\n",
    "\n",
    "*What it does:*  \n",
    "Creates a reader object that lets you loop through each row in the CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Why it’s used:*  \n",
    "This object breaks each line into a list of values, making it easy to process row-by-row.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 7. Looping Through Rows in the CSV File\n",

    "`for variable in iterable:`\n",
    "\n",
    "*What it does:*  \n",
    "Loops through each row returned by the reader object.\n",
    "\n",

    "## 8. Printing Each Row\n",
    "\n",
